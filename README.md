Healthcare Price Transparency Data Project
Overview
This project focuses on gathering, cleaning, and analyzing healthcare price transparency data from multiple hospitals in Miami, Taampa and Philidelphia regions. The primary goal is to give consumers clear insights into how much treatments cost across different hospitals and how various insurance plans affect out-of-pocket expenses.

Objectives
Data Collection: Acquire pricing information from 20+ hospitals across 3 regions, including negotiated rates, standard charges, inpatient vs. outpatient costs, etc.
Data Cleaning & Merging: Normalize column names, remove duplicates, handle missing values, and combine datasets into a single source of truth.

Analysis & Insights:

Identify which hospitals offer lower or higher costs for common treatments.
Compare insurance coverage and out-of-pocket expenses.
Spot regional cost differences and trends.
Visualization: Generate charts and dashboards to help stakeholders see at-a-glance cost comparisons, coverage variances, and notable pricing patterns.

Reporting: Summarize key findings to guide policy decisions, improve pricing transparency, and help patients select cost-effective healthcare options.
